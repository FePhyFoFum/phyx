% A form of \verb that allows linebreaks at certain characters or
% combinations of characters, accepts reconfiguration, and can usually
% be used in the argument to another command.  It is intended for email
% addresses, hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally
% have no spaces.  The font may be selected using the \urlstyle command,
% and new url-like commands can be defined using \urldef.
%
% Usage:    Conditions:
% \url{ }   If the argument contains any "%", "#", or "^^", or ends with
%           "\", it can't be used in the argument to another command.
%           The argument must not contain unbalanced braces.
% \url|  |  ...where "|" is any character not used in the argument and not
%           "{" or a space.  The same restrictions as above except that the
%           argument may contain unbalanced braces.
% \xyz      for "\xyz" a defined-url;  this can be used anywhere, no matter
%           what characters it contains.

% url.sty  ver 1.4   02-Mar-1999   Donald Arseneau   asnd@reg.triumf.ca
%
% This package defines "\url", a form of "\verb" that allows linebreaks,
% and can often be used in the argument to another command.  It can be
% configured to print in different formats, and is particularly useful for
% hypertext links, email addresses, directories/paths, etc.  The font may
% be selected using the "\urlstyle" command and pre-defined text can be
% stored with the "\urldef" command. New url-like commands can be defined,
% and a "\path" command is provided this way.
%
% Usage:    Conditions:
% \url{ }   If the argument contains any "%", "#", or "^^", or ends with
%           "\", it can't be used in the argument to another command.
%           The argument must not contain unbalanced braces.
% \url|  |  ...where "|" is any character not used in the argument and not
%           "{" or a space.  The same restrictions as above except that the
%           argument may contain unbalanced braces.
% \xyz      for "\xyz" a defined-url;  this can be used anywhere, no matter
%           what characters it contains.
%
% The "\url" command is fragile, and its argument is likely to be very
% fragile, but a defined-url is robust.
%
% Package Option:  obeyspaces
% Ordinarily, all spaces are ignored in the url-text.  The "[obeyspaces]"
% option allows spaces, but may introduce spurious spaces when a url
% containing "\" characters is given in the argument to another command.
% So if you need to obey spaces you can say "\usepackage[obeyspaces]{url}",
% and if you need both spaces and backslashes, use a `defined-url' for
% anything with "\".
%
% Package Option:  hyphens
% Ordinarily, breaks are not allowed after "-" characters because this
% leads to confusion. (Is the "-" part of the address or just a hyphen?)
% The package option "[hyphens]" allows breaks after explicit hyphen
% characters.  The "\url" command will *never ever* hyphenate words.
%
% Package Option:  spaces
% Likewise, breaks are not usually allowed after spaces under the
% "[obeyspaces]" option, but giving the options "[obeyspaces,spaces]"
% will allow breaks at those spaces.
%
% Package Option:  T1
% This signifies that you will be using T1-encoded fonts which contain
% some characters missing from most older (OT1) encoded TeX fonts.  This
% changes the default definition for "\urlstyle{rm}".
%
% Defining a defined-url:
% Take for example the email address "myself%node@gateway.net" which could
% not be given (using "\url" or "\verb") in a caption or parbox due to the
% percent sign.  This address can be predefined with
%    \urldef{\myself}\url{myself%node@gateway.net}   or
%    \urldef{\myself}\url|myself%node@gateway.net|
% and then you may use "\myself" instead of "\url{myself%node@gateway.net}"
% in an argument, and even in a moving argument like a caption because a
% defined-url is robust.
%
% Style:
% You can switch the style of printing using "\urlstyle{tt}", where "tt"
% can be any defined style.  The pre-defined styles are "tt", "rm", "sf",
% and "same" which all allow the same linebreaks but different fonts --
% the first three select a specific font and the "same" style uses the
% current text font.  You can define your own styles with different fonts
% and/or line-breaking by following the explanations below.  The "\url"
% command follows whatever the currently-set style dictates.
%
% Alternate commands:
% It may be desireable to have different things treated differently, each
% in a predefined style; e.g., if you want directory paths to always be
% in tt and email addresses to be rm, then you would define new url-like
% commands as follows:
%
%    \newcommand\email{\begingroup \urlstyle{rm}\Url}
%    \newcommand\directory{\begingroup \urlstyle{tt}\Url}
%
% You must follow this format closely, and NOTE that the final command is
% "\Url", not "\url".  In fact, the "\directory" example is exactly the
% "\path" definition which is pre-defined in the package.  If you look
% above, you will see that "\url" is defined with
%    \newcommand\url{\begingroup \Url}
% I.e., using whatever url-style has been selected.
%
% You can make a defined-url for these other styles, using the usual
% "\urldef" command as in this example:
%
%    \urldef{\myself}{\email}{myself%node.domain@gateway.net}
%
% which makes "\myself" act like "\email{myself%node.domain@gateway.net}",
% if the "\email" command is defined as above.  The "\myself" command
% would then be robust.
%
% Defining styles:
% Before describing how to customize the printing style, it is best to
% mention something about the unusual implementation of "\url".  Although
% the material is textual in nature, and the font specification required
% is a text-font command, the text is actually typeset in *math* mode.
% This allows the context-sensitive linebreaking, but also accounts for
% the default behavior of ignoring spaces.  Now on to defining styles.
%
% To change the font or the list of characters that allow linebreaks, you
% could redefine the commands "\UrlFont", "\UrlBreaks", "\UrlSpecials" etc.
% directly in the document, but it is better to define a new `url-style'
% (following the example of "\url@ttstyle" and "\url@rmstyle") which defines
% all of "\UrlBigbreaks", "\UrlNoBreaks", "\UrlBreaks", "\UrlSpecials", and
% "\UrlFont".
%
% Changing font:
% The "\UrlFont" command selects the font.  The definition of "\UrlFont"
% done by the pre-defined styles varies to cope with a variety of LaTeX
% font selection schemes, but it could be as simple as "\def\UrlFont{\tt}".
% Depending on the font selected, some characters may need to be defined
% in the "\UrlSpecials" list because many fonts don't contain all the
% standard input characters.
%
% Changing linebreaks:
% The list of characters that allow line-breaks is given by "\UrlBreaks"
% and "\UrlBigBreaks", which have the format "\do\c" for character "c".
% The differences are that `BigBreaks' have a lower penalty and have
% different breakpoints when in sequence (as in "http://"): `BigBreaks'
% are treated as mathrels while `Breaks' are mathbins (see The TeXbook,
% p.170). In particular, a series of `BigBreak' characters will break at
% the end and only at the end; a series of `Break' characters will break
% after the first and after every following *pair*; there will be no
% break after a `Break' character if a `BigBreak' follows.  In the case
% of "http://" it doesn't matter whether ":" is a `Break' or `BigBreak' --
% the breaks are the same in either case; but for DECnet nodes with "::"
% it is important to prevent breaks *between* the colons, and that is why
% colons are `BigBreaks'.
%
% It is possible for characters to prevent breaks after the next following
% character (I use this for parentheses).  Specify these in "\UrlNoBreaks".
%
% You can do arbitrarily complex things with characters by making them
% active in math mode (mathcode hex-8000) and specifying the definition(s)
% in "\UrlSpecials".  This is used in the rm and sf styles for OT1 font
% encoding to handle several characters that are not present in those
% computer-modern style fonts.  See the definition of "\Url@do", which
% is used by both "\url@rmstyle" and "\url@sfstyle"; it handles missing
% characters via "\UrlSpecials".  The nominal format for setting each
% special character "c" is: "\do\c{<definition>}", but you can include
% other definitions too.
%
%
% If all this sounds confusing ... well, it is!  But I hope you won't need
% to redefine breakpoints -- the default assignments seem to work well for
% a wide variety of applications.  If you do need to make changes, you can
% test for breakpoints using regular math mode and the characters "+=(a".
%
% Yet more flexibility:
% You can also customize the verbatim text by defining "\UrlRight" and/or
% "\UrlLeft", e.g., for ISO formatting of urls surrounded by "<  >", define
%
%    \renewcommand\url{\begingroup \def\UrlLeft{<url: }\def\UrlRight{>}%
%        \urlstyle{tt}\Url}
%
% The meanings of "\UrlLeft" and "\UrlRight" are *not* reproduced verbatim.
% This lets you use formatting commands there, but you must be careful not
% to use TeX's special characters ("\^_%~#$&{}" etc.) improperly.
% You can also define "\UrlLeft" to reprocess the verbatim text, but the
% format of the definition is special:
%
%    \def\UrlLeft#1\UrlRight{ ... do things with #1 ... }
%
% Yes, that is "#1" followed by "\UrlRight" then the definition.  For
% example, to put a hyperTeX hypertext link in the DVI file:
%
%    \def\UrlLeft#1\UrlRight{\special{html:<a href="#1">}#1\special{html:</a>}}
%
% Using this technique, url.sty can provide a convenient interface for
% performing various operations on verbatim text.  You don't even need
% to print out the argument!  For greatest efficiency in such obscure
% applications, you can define a null url-style where all the lists like
% "\UrlBreaks" are empty.
